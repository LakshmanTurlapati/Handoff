## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Codex Mobile is a remote window into local Codex, not a hosted coding workspace
- [Init]: `codex app-server` is the primary integration target; `codex exec --json` is fallback automation support
- [Init]: Pairing must use terminal confirmation in addition to QR scanning

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Codex app-server WebSocket transport is documented as experimental; the local bridge should prefer stdio first
- QR/device pairing must defend against hijack and replay from day one
- Multi-instance relay routing on Fly.io must be proven before broad rollout

## Session Continuity
